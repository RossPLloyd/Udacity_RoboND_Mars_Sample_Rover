# Udacity_RoboND_Mars_Sample_Rover
Repository for the Search and Sample Return Project I undertook as the first project on the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree

In this project I completed python code to allow a virtual rover to navigate a "Mars" environment autonomously and retrieve "rock samples" which were identified using computer vision techniques. For details please see write up: AAMAIN/Ross Lloyd - Search and Sample Return Project Writeup.ipynb
